The require function given earlier in this chapter supports this type of dependency cycle.
  Can you see how it handles cycles?

A:
Apparently, the question is actually asking how it is possible
  for CommonJS and require function enables dependency cycle
  to happen.
This is done due to the feature of the require function where
  it "adds the interface object for a module to its cache
  before it starts loading the module"
  This ensures that the depended module already exists in
    the program.
