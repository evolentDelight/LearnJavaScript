If you were to write that project as a modular program,
  what modules would you create?
Which module would depend on which other module,
  and what would their interfaces look like?
A:
Robot should be a module
VillageState and roads should be in its own module
  Graphs and Routes should depend on the VillageState and roads

Which pieces are likely to be available prewritten on NPM?
  Would you prefer to use an NPM package or write them yourself?
A:
  randomPick would most likely be available prewritten
